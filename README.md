![Phase portrait of zeta over the critical strip](docs/domain.png)

The Riemann Hypothesis says every non-trivial zero of ζ(s) sits on the line
Re(s) = 1/2. On that line ζ is complex, but multiply it by the phase e^(iθ(t)) and
you get the real-valued Riemann-Siegel Z function, which changes sign at every zero.
This repo computes θ, Z, ζ(s) itself, the zeros and the Gram points straight from
the formulas, checks the results against mpmath, and uses Turing's method to prove
the zero count is complete: all 138,069 zeros of ζ with 0 < Im s ≤ 100000 are on
the critical line and simple. It also draws ζ over the complex plane, and it
compares 100,000 zeros near t = 5·10⁶ with the eigenvalue statistics of large
random Hermitian matrices.

Animations, the explicit formula for π(x) and a browser version come next.

## The math

### Theta

From Stirling's series for log Γ:

```
θ(t) = t/2·log(t/2π) − t/2 − π/8 + 1/(48t) + 7/(5760t³) + …
```

accurate to about 1e-13 for t ≥ 10.

### Riemann-Siegel formula

With a = sqrt(t/2π), N = ⌊a⌋ and p = a − N:

```
Z(t) ≈ 2·Σ_{n=1..N} cos(θ(t) − t·log n)/sqrt(n)  +  (−1)^(N−1)·a^(−1/2)·Σ_{k=0..4} C_k(p)·a^(−k)
```

Only about sqrt(t/2π) terms are needed, so at t = 10⁶ that's 398 terms. The
corrections come from Ψ(p) = cos(2π(p² − p − 1/16)) / cos(2πp) and its
derivatives:

```
C0 = Ψ
C1 = −Ψ⁽³⁾/(96π²)
C2 = Ψ⁽²⁾/(64π²) + Ψ⁽⁶⁾/(18432π⁴)
C3 = −Ψ⁽¹⁾/(64π²) − Ψ⁽⁵⁾/(3840π⁴) − Ψ⁽⁹⁾/(5308416π⁶)
C4 = Ψ/(128π²) + 19Ψ⁽⁴⁾/(24576π⁴) + 11Ψ⁽⁸⁾/(5898240π⁶) + Ψ⁽¹²⁾/(2038431744π⁸)
```

Twelve derivatives of a ratio of cosines is not something to do by hand. Ψ looks
singular at p = 1/4 and 3/4, but the numerator vanishes there too and Ψ is in fact
entire. So the code expands Ψ(1/2 + z) = −cos(2πz² − 5π/8)/cos(2πz) as a Taylor
series in z by dividing the two cosine series. That division runs at 110 digits
in mpmath, because 1/cos has poles at |z| = 1/4 and rounding errors grow like 4^j.
Derivatives of a power series are shifted coefficients, so each C_k becomes a
degree-90 polynomial in z, evaluated with Horner in doubles, and the removable
singularities need no special case. The tests rebuild C1 to C4 from mpmath's
numerical derivatives of Ψ and agree to 1e-15.

![Riemann-Siegel error against t for 0 to 4 correction terms](docs/rs_error.png)

Each extra term should buy another factor of t^(−1/2). Over t in [200, 2000], the
largest value of |error|·t^((2k+3)/4) is:

| terms | error order | measured constant |
|---|---|---|
| C0 | t^(−3/4) | 0.119 |
| C0 to C1 | t^(−5/4) | 0.052 |
| C0 to C2 | t^(−7/4) | 0.0090 |
| C0 to C3 | t^(−9/4) | 0.029 |
| C0 to C4 | t^(−11/4) | 0.015 |

The constants come out about the same over [20, 200], which is the real check that
each C_k is right: a wrong coefficient would leave the previous order behind.
The bottom right of the chart is a different story. Past t ≈ 3000 the C3 and C4
curves hit a floor near 3e-11 set by doubles: the phases θ(t) − t·log n are around
10⁵ radians there, so each cosine is only good to about 1e-11. Gabcke (1979)
proved explicit bounds of this form for t ≥ 200, which is why the code trusts
z_rs from t = 200 up and calls mpmath below.

### ζ(s) everywhere

`zeta.py` has no mpmath in the loop. For Re s ≥ 0 it uses Euler-Maclaurin:

```
ζ(s) = Σ_{n<N} n^(−s) + N^(1−s)/(s−1) + N^(−s)/2
       + Σ_{k=1..M} B_2k/(2k)! · s(s+1)…(s+2k−2) · N^(−s−2k+1) + R
```

with Backlund's bound: |R| is at most |s+2M+1|/(σ+2M+1) times the first omitted
term, for σ > −(2M+1). N = 10 + ⌊|t|/π⌋ makes the Bernoulli terms shrink
geometrically, and M grows until the bound drops below 1e-16 relative. The
Bernoulli numbers are exact `Fraction`s. For Re s < 0 it switches to the
functional equation ζ(s) = χ(s)ζ(1 − s), with
χ(s) = 2^s·π^(s−1)·sin(πs/2)·Γ(1 − s) assembled in log space, since at large |t|
the sine overflows and Γ underflows. log Γ is Stirling's series after shifting
|z| past 15, summing the logs of the shifts so the imaginary part stays on the
continuous branch.

Against mpmath on 300 random points with |Re s| ≤ 30 and |Im s| ≤ 200 the
relative error stays under 1e-12. On the critical line at t = 10⁴ the absolute
error is 1.4e-11 (the same phase floor as above). The tests also check
ζ(1 − 2k) = −B_2k/(2k) for k up to 11, that Backlund's bound really bounds the
error and is within 50x of it, that χ(1/2 + it) = e^(−2iθ(t)), and that
e^(iθ)ζ(1/2 + it) is real and equals the Riemann-Siegel Z.

### Phase portrait

The picture at the top is `plot_domain()`: ζ(σ + it) for −5 ≤ σ ≤ 6 and
0 ≤ t ≤ 60, about 600,000 points. Hue is the argument of ζ, and the brightness
ramps up and resets every time |ζ| doubles, so the shading edges are level curves
of |ζ| (Wegert's enhanced phase portrait). A zero is a point where every color
meets, going around once counterclockwise; the pole at s = 1 goes the other way.
All the zeros in the strip sit on the dashed line σ = 1/2, the trivial zeros at
−2 and −4 sit on the left edge, and to the right of σ = 2 the picture is almost
flat red because ζ(s) is close to 1 there.

This needed ζ on arrays. `zeta`, `chi` and `loggamma` now take any array shape:
every point keeps its own N = 10 + ⌊|t|/π⌋, the main sums are one masked
(points × n) matrix built in chunks, and the Euler-Maclaurin tail drops each point
out of the loop as soon as its Backlund bound is small enough. The whole grid
takes 1.05 s, against 6.5 s for a Python loop over the old scalar version.

### Analytic continuation

![Partial sums of three series for zeta at the first zero](docs/continuation.png)

Σ n^(−s) only converges for σ > 1, and at the first zero s = 1/2 + 14.1347i the
partial sums spiral outward like N^(1/2)/|s − 1|. Two cheap fixes both land on
ζ(s) = 0. The alternating series η(s) = Σ (−1)^(n−1) n^(−s) converges for σ > 0,
and ζ = η/(1 − 2^(1−s)), but its error only falls like N^(−1/2). Adding the
first two Euler-Maclaurin terms N^(1−s)/(s−1) + N^(−s)/2 to the raw partial sum
gives an error of order |s|·N^(−σ−1), N^(−3/2) on the critical line, and it works
anywhere with σ > −1. The tests check both rates.

The functional equation is easiest to see through
ξ(s) = ½s(s − 1)π^(−s/2)Γ(s/2)ζ(s), which cancels the pole and the trivial zeros.
`xi(s)` evaluates it from the right half plane and reflects with ξ(s) = ξ(1 − s);
the tests check it against mpmath, check ξ(0) = ξ(1) = 1/2 and ξ(2) = π/6, and
check that it is real on the critical line.

![zeta(1/2 + it) traced in the complex plane for t up to 40](docs/spiral.png)

On the critical line itself, ζ(1/2 + it) traces loops that pass through the
origin once per zero. It starts at ζ(1/2) = −1.4604, and between t = 0 and 40 it
goes through 0 six times.

### Zeros

![Z(t) on the critical line with its first 13 zeros](docs/z_function.png)

Sign changes of Z on a grid, refined with the Illinois method
(regula falsi that halves a stuck endpoint's weight). All 29 zeros below t = 100
match mpmath's `zetazero` to 1e-9, and z_rs finds the same 29 to within 4e-6.

### Gram points and Gram's law

These solve θ(g_n) = nπ. θ is increasing and convex there, so Newton's method
started to the right of the root slides monotonically onto it. It's vectorized:
the first 100,001 Gram points take 0.12 s.

![Z(t) around t = 280 with Gram points; g_126 and g_134 break Gram's law](docs/gram_points.png)

At g_n, e^(iθ) = (−1)^n, so if Z behaved like a cosine with one zero per Gram
interval we would always have (−1)^n Z(g_n) > 0. That's Gram's law. It first
fails at g_126 (Hutchinson, 1925). Up to n = 1000, 95.8% of Gram points are good;
up to 10,000, 91.8%; up to 100,000 (t ≈ 74,922), 88.9%.

A Gram block is a run [g_j, g_k) between consecutive good points. Rosser's rule
says a block of length k − j contains at least k − j zeros. The checker samples Z
inside each block, doubling the density until it sees enough sign changes. Up to
n = 100,000 every block passes:

| block length | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| count | 78,694 | 9,445 | 778 | 19 | 1 |

Rosser's rule does fail eventually; Brent found the first failure near
g_13999525. The signs come from z_rs with all four corrections. Any |Z| below 1e-6
is recomputed with mpmath before it's trusted, and below t = 200 mpmath is used
throughout.

### Turing's method

Sign changes of Z give a lower bound on N(T), the number of zeros with
0 < Im s ≤ T. A zero off the critical line, or a double zero, wouldn't show up as
a sign change. The upper bound comes from S(t) = N(t) − θ(t)/π − 1: Lehman proved
|∫ S(t) dt| ≤ 1.7 + 0.114·log t₂ over any [t₁, t₂] above 168, so S can't stay
positive for long. Brent turned that into a block count. If K consecutive Gram
blocks [g_n, g_p) obey Rosser's rule and

```
K ≥ (0.114/6π)·log² g_p + ((1.7 − 0.114·log 2π)/6π)·log g_p   (≈ 0.0061 log² + 0.08 log)
```

then N(g_n) ≤ n + 1. `verify_zeros(T)` finds a good Gram point g_n ≥ T, counts
n + 1 sign changes of Z below it, and finds the K blocks past it. The two bounds
meet, so every zero up to g_n is a sign change, which means it is on the line and
simple. For T = 100,000 it runs in 9 seconds, needs K = 2 blocks, and stops at
g_138068 ≈ 100000.29 with N = 138,069 (mpmath's `nzeros` agrees). The tests
cross-check smaller heights the same way.

### Zero spacings and random matrices

![Spacing histogram and pair correlation of 100,000 zeros near t = 5 million](docs/spacing.png)

Montgomery conjectured in 1973 that the pair correlation of the zeros, measured in
units of the mean spacing, is 1 − (sin πu/πu)². Dyson recognized it as the pair
correlation of eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices (GUE), and Odlyzko's
computations from 1987 on confirmed it numerically.

`zeros_between(n_lo, n_hi)` finds every zero between two good Gram points. It
evaluates Z at the Gram points, samples each Gram block more finely until it has as
many sign changes as the block has intervals, then refines every bracket at once
with a vectorized Illinois method on z_rs. Between n = 10⁷ and 10⁷ + 100,000 it
finds exactly 100,000 zeros in 18 s. That count matters for the statistics: a
missed pair of close zeros would hide exactly the small spacings the plot is
about. The zeros are unfolded with x = θ(γ)/π, which makes the mean spacing 1.

The GUE curve is the exact sine-kernel answer, not the Wigner surmise. The
probability of no eigenvalue in an interval of length s is the Fredholm
determinant E(s) = det(I − K) with K(x, y) = sin π(x − y)/(π(x − y)) on [0, s].
Following Bornemann (2010), Gauss-Legendre quadrature with 40 nodes turns it into
an ordinary 40×40 determinant, and the error falls exponentially with the node
count (20 and 60 nodes agree to 1e-12). The spacing density is p(s) = E''(s); E
is entire, so the code interpolates it with a degree-80 Chebyshev series on
[0, 6] and differentiates the series twice. Checks: p(s) matches
π²s²/3 − 2π⁴s⁴/45 + π⁶s⁶/315 for small s, the derivatives agree with 30-digit
mpmath to 3e-10, p integrates to 1 with mean 1, and the variance comes out
0.17999 (the Wigner surmise gives 3π/8 − 1 = 0.1781). An independent check
samples 300 random 120×120 GUE matrices: the KS distance between their bulk
spacings and the sine-kernel CDF is 0.0044, against 0.28 for Poisson.

The zeros fit GUE well, but not perfectly, and the gap shrinks with height. For
100,000 consecutive zeros starting at three heights:

| first zero | t range | spacing variance | KS distance to GUE | R₂ − Montgomery, 0.3 < u < 0.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| n = 10⁵ | 74,924 to 139,503 | 0.1636 | 0.0174 | −0.012 |
| n = 10⁶ | 600,271 to 654,852 | 0.1668 | 0.0138 | −0.013 |
| n = 10⁷ | 4,992,382 to 5,038,615 | 0.1693 | 0.0110 | −0.013 |
| GUE | | 0.1800 | 0 | 0 |

The zeros are more regular than GUE at these heights: smaller variance, a taller
peak in the histogram, and slightly fewer close pairs. The variance and the KS
distance move toward GUE as t grows; the dip in the pair correlation barely moves
over this range. This is the finite-height
effect Bogomolny, Keating and coauthors explained by matching the zeros at height
t to unitary matrices of effective size log(t/2π)/√(12Λ), where Λ ≈ 1.573, which is
only about 3 at t = 5·10⁶. It decays like 1/log² t, so it is still visible in
Odlyzko's data near zero number 10²³.
